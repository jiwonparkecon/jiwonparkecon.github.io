“Competition Between Public and Private Schools: Evidence from the Great Recession” [[draft](https://jiwonparkecon.github.io/files/jmp_jp_recent.pdf)] (*Job Market Paper*)(*Under Review*)
<details>
<summary>
Abstract
</summary>
<p>This paper asks whether funding for public schools affects parents' decision to send their children to private schools. In the wake of the Great Recession, funding for public K-12 education fell precipitously in the United States and stayed low for several years. Critically, states with greater historical reliance on state appropriations (rather than local or federal appropriations) and states with no income tax experienced larger cuts. These two features were set decades before the Great Recession, changed little over time, and do not predict other impacts of the Recession, such as unemployment, providing plausibly exogenous sources for variation in public school funding. I combine these two sources with the timing of the Great Recession to instrument for local public school funding. I find that students exposed to a $1,000 (9.0 percent) decrease in per-pupil funding are more likely to enroll in private schools by 0.48 to 0.59 percentage points (4.5 to 5.6 percent). I show further that the effect is strongest among high socioeconomic status students living in disadvantaged areas. These findings suggest that reductions in public school resources lead to greater inequality in education and negatively change student composition in public schools through school choice.</p>

"Does Facility-Based Delivery Save Lives? Evidence from Rwanda" [[draft](https://jiwonparkecon.github.io/files/rwanda-recent.pdf)] (*Under Review*)
<details>
<summary>
Abstract
</summary>
<p>In 2006, Rwanda initiated Facility-Based Childbirth Policy (FBCP) to promote facility-based child delivery (FBD) and prenatal care. This paper studies the effect of this reform on FBD and prenatal care utilization, and childhood mortality rates. To identify the causal effect, I utilize the geographical variation of FBD in the baseline period and the timing of the policy in a difference-in-difference framework. My estimates suggest that the health reform increased FBD and the number of prenatal visits by 10-14 percentage points and 0.11-0.16 times, respectively.  Next, I examine whether the health reform reduced childhood mortality rates. The reform has a substantial effect on infant (under one year) and child (under five years) mortality, 12 and 25 reductions per 1,000 live births, respectively. However, the overall reduction in newborn (seven days) neonatal (30 days) mortality is not statistically significant despite a large increase in FBD. The results are robust to using alternative definitions of treatment status. I show that other policy interventions like performance-based financing schemes can strengthen the treatment effect on newborn and neonatal mortality, implying the importance of multiple approaches to reduce mortality rates. </p>

“Oursource to India: The Impact of Service Outsourcing to India on the Labor Market in the US”[[draft(jiwonparkecon.github.io/files/offshore_draft_recent.pdf)]]
<details>
<summary>
Abstract
</summary>
<p>
While the impact of outsourcing in manufacturing industries is well-documented, relatively little is known about service outsourcing despite its growing importance in the economy. This paper is one of the few papers studying the effect of service outsourcing on the US's labor market, focusing on India, one of the most popular outsourcing destination countries. I examine whether the increase in service outsourcing to India has reduced the employment of the occupations with greater exposure to Indian service Imports. To account for endogeneity, I instrument for the growth of the US's service import from India exploiting the change in Indian import in European countries. The occupation level analysis gives a mixed result. An increase in service imports reduces the total employment from 2000 to 2007; however, this effect attenuates in the later period of 2007 to 2017. The change is skill-biased: the reduction in employment is smaller for college-educated workers in the first period, and the sign reverses later.
