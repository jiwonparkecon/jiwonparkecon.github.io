“Public School Funding and Private Schools in the United States: Evidence from the Great Recession” [[draft](https://jiwonparkecon.github.io/files/Private_School_ver8-4.pdf)] (*Job Market Paper*) (*Under Review*)
<details>
<summary>
Abstract
</summary>
<p>This paper asks whether funding for public schools affects private school enrollment. To examine the causality, I utilize the fact that states with greater historical reliance on state appropriations and states with no income tax experienced larger cuts for public K-12 education funding after the Great Recession. I find that students exposed to a $1,000 (9.2 percent) decrease in per-pupil funding are more likely to enroll in private schools by 0.46 to 0.62 percentage points. I show further that the effect is strongest among high socioeconomic status students living in disadvantaged areas, which suggests a change in student composition.</p>

"Health Reforms, Facility-Based Delivery, and Newborn's Health: Evidence from Rwanda" [[draft](https://jiwonparkecon.github.io/files/Rwanda_JP.pdf)] (R&R at _Journal of Demographic Economics_)
<details>
<summary>
Abstract
</summary>
<p>In 2006, Rwanda initiated Facility-Based Childbirth Policy (FBCP) to promote facility-based child delivery (FBD) and prenatal care. This paper studies the effect of this reform on FBD and prenatal care utilization, and childhood mortality rates. To identify the causal effect, I utilize the geographical variation of FBD in the baseline period and the timing of the policy in a difference-in-difference framework. My estimates suggest that the health reform increased FBD and the number of prenatal visits by 10-14 percentage points and 0.11-0.16 times, respectively.  Next, I examine whether the health reform reduced childhood mortality rates. The reform has a substantial effect on infant (under one year) and child (under five years) mortality, 12 and 25 reductions per 1,000 live births, respectively. However, the overall reduction in newborn (seven days) neonatal (30 days) mortality is not statistically significant despite a large increase in FBD. The results are robust to using alternative definitions of treatment status. I show that other policy interventions like performance-based financing schemes can strengthen the treatment effect on newborn and neonatal mortality, implying the importance of multiple approaches to reduce mortality rates. </p>
