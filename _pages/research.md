Abstract
</summary>
<p>Utilizing mobility data from 15 million smartphone users, we examine the pandemic's impact on in-person religious attendance in the US. Attendance declined sharply in March 2020 and recovered slowly thereafter. Notably, religious attendance rebounded more gradually than other activities like restaurant visits. There were also variations across religious groups, with Catholics returning at a slower pace than Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. By 2022, Protestants and Catholics reached around 85-90 percent of their 2019 attendance; other groups such as Latter-day Saints, Eastern Orthodox Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus had fully returned to pre-pandemic levels. We then introduce a novel approach to examine the impact of religious policies on behavior, leveraging variations in the timing of dispensation rescissions by US Catholic bishops. Using a difference-in-differences event study model, we find a short-term 2-4 percentage point increase in Catholic weekend church attendance following the lifting of dispensations, compared to the 2019 baseline. However, this effect fades over time and is smaller than the attendance surge seen after reopening churches post-lockdowns. These results suggest that religious policies impact behavior, though their effects may be transient.n.</p>

“Public Education Funding Cuts and Enrollment Shift to Private Schools: Evidence from the Great Recession” [[Link to Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3739064)] [[Online Appendix](https://jiwonparkecon.github.io/files/privateschool_appendix.pdf)]

Abstract
</summary>
<p>This paper asks whether funding for public schools affects private school enrollment. To examine the causality, I utilize the fact that states with greater historical reliance on state appropriations and states with no income tax experienced larger cuts for public K-12 education funding after the Great Recession. I find that students exposed to a $1,000 (9.2 percent) decrease in per-pupil funding are more likely to enroll in private schools by 0.46 to 0.62 percentage points. I show further that the effect is strongest among high socioeconomic status students living in disadvantaged areas, which suggests a change in student composition.</p>

"Health Reforms, Facility-Based Delivery, and Newborn's Health: Evidence from Rwanda" [[draft](https://jiwonparkecon.github.io/files/Rwanda_JODE_rev2.pdf)] [[Online Appendix](https://jiwonparkecon.github.io/files/Rwanda_appendix.pdf)] (R&R at _Journal of Demographic Economics_)

Abstract
</summary>
<p>In 2006, Rwanda initiated Facility-Based Childbirth Policy (FBCP) to promote facility-based child delivery (FBD) and prenatal care. This paper studies the effect of this reform on FBD and prenatal care utilization, and childhood mortality rates. To identify the causal effect, I utilize the geographical variation of FBD in the baseline period and the timing of the policy in a difference-in-difference framework. My estimates suggest that the health reform increased FBD and the number of prenatal visits by 10-14 percentage points and 0.11-0.16 times, respectively.  Next, I examine whether the health reform reduced childhood mortality rates. The reform has a substantial effect on infant (under one year) and child (under five years) mortality, 12 and 25 reductions per 1,000 live births, respectively. However, the overall reduction in newborn (seven days) neonatal (30 days) mortality is not statistically significant despite a large increase in FBD. The results are robust to using alternative definitions of treatment status. I show that other policy interventions like performance-based financing schemes can strengthen the treatment effect on newborn and neonatal mortality, implying the importance of multiple approaches to reduce mortality rates. </p>
