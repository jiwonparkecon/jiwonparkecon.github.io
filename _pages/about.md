Welcome!

I recently graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. Now I am an associate research fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP).

My research interests are in Labor, Education, and Development. My JMP focuses on the competition between public and private schools in the US K-12 education.
